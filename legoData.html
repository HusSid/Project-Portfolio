                            <h2>Lego Sets Analysis</h2>
                            <p>Analysis was carried out on <a href="https://github.com/KeithGalli/lego-analysis/tree/master/datasets">yearly set releases</a> by LEGO since 1950 with three questions in mind:</p>
                            <h3>1. How many unique sets were released per year?</h3> 
                            <ul>
								<li>Each unique set has its own set number so the data was filtered according to both year and set number.</li>
								<li>The results show a large increase in sales from 2000, which is likely related to the increased production of sci-fi and animated movies during this time period.</li>
							</ul>

                            <div class="box alt">
                                <div style="text-align: center;" class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                    <div class="col-12"><span class="image featured"><img width="800" src="images/setsperyear.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                                </div>
                            </div>
							<h3>2. Of all licenced sets released, how many were Star Wars themed?</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>To answer this, two datasets had to be merged via an inner join based on the column common to both: 'parent_theme'.</li>
								<li>The data was then grouped and counted based on whether the sets were licenced or not, showing that <b>51% of all licenced sets were Stars Wars themed.</b></li>
								<li>Clearly, Star Wars dominates the overall market for LEGO sets which is important to consider for marketing.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>3. What were the most popular licenced sets of each year?</h3>
                            <ul>
								<li>Grouping the data by year then filtering by theme allows us to see that every year, <b>Stars Wars sets were the most popular</b> LEGO sets sold <b>except for 2017, when Super Hero sets overtook them.</b></li>
								<li>This could indicate a shift in interest by the target market so it may be wise to consider shifting manufacturing and advertisements to be more in-line with current trends.</li>
							</ul>
