									<h2>Sales Data Analysis</h2>
									<p><a href="https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks/tree/master/SalesAnalysis/Sales_Data">Monthly sales records</a> for an electronics store were analysed to understand how advertisements could be delivered more effectively to improve customer spending.</p>
									By grouping the data, we can see that sales were highest:
									<ol>
										<li>In <b>December due to the Christmas holiday season</b> and <b>October as students return to school</b> so marketing during these months and the weeks leading up to them could generate more sales as people are already on the lookout for products to buy. Offering discounts on less active months may also encourage more purchases throughout the year.</li>
										
										<li>In <b>San Francisco due to the large number of tech companies</b> located in the city that require electronic devices. Tailoring advertisements based on location could help customers find more relevant products, potentially increasing the likelihood of making a sale.</li>
										
										<li>At <b>lunchtimes and evenings</b> since people usually have some free time to engage in more leisurely activities. Advertisements at or slightly before these times may have greater influence and could promote more sales.</li>
									</ol>

									In terms of products sold:
									<ul>
										<li><b>Cheaper, more commonly used items sold the most</b> such as headphones, charging cables and batteries and were often purchased together with smart phones. Advertising products in bundles or offering package deals then could be an effective way to persuade customers to buy additional items.</li>
										
										<li>The <b>Macbook Pro also sold well despite its high price</b> which is likely due to its popularity among professionals and students. Highlighting products that are useful to a customer's field of study or work could convince them to purchase items they otherwise would not have considered.</li>
