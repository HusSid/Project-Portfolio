							<h2>Object Detection</h2>
							<p>The pre-trained <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/">YOLOv3</a> convolutional neural network was used to accurately detect and label objects from the <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home">Microsoft COCO dataset</a>, as shown in the images below.</p>

							There were instances where the model was unable to detect all of the objects because:
							<ul>
								<li>The model was <b>not trained to recognise every category of object</b> in the image if they were not present within the COCO dataset.</li>
								<li>The <b>limitations of the YOLOv3 model</b> itself in terms of its object classification and localisation methods.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Simply adding more images to increase the number of categories in the dataset would allow the model to detect a larger variety of objects but to improve detection accuracy and speed, the architecture of the neural network would require modification. This has been achieved in later versions of the YOLO model (<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/blog/yolo-object-detection-explained">see article</a>) and would, therefore, yield superior results in an object detection system.</p>

In either case, the accuracy of the model could be improved by training with more diverse types of images of objects, which should allow the neural network to recognise more objects in various orientations and visibility conditions.</p> -->
